#### Seeing you guys taking interest in coding, and some of you looking for projects to practice, Codetrophs is here with its new programme called the *March code* where you can practice your programming skills through our provided projects based on basic to intermidiate programming.


This March Code Program aims to simplify and guide the way beginners make their first contribution. If you are looking to make your first contribution, follow the steps below.

#### If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

## Fork this repository.

Fork this repository by clicking the fork button at the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.


Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone https://github.com/CodeTrophs/MarchCode.git
```


## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd MarchCode
```
- Add your code file in Day/<USERNAME.py>

For Example : aryasoni98.py or aryasoni98.java or aryasoni98.cpp etc...

#### Replace <YOUR-USERNAME> with your GitHub username in this guide.


Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b contribution
```

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add file-name
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Add <file-name>"
```

replacing `<file-name>` with your name.

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
